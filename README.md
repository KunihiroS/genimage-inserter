## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest release
2. Create a folder `genimage-inserter` in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory
3. Copy the downloaded files into the folder
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**

## Configuration

### Plugin Settings

| Setting | Description | Required |
|---------|-------------|:--------:|
| `.env` file path | Path to your `.env` file (must be **outside** your vault for security). Supports `~` for home directory (e.g., `~/.config/secrets/.env`) | ✓ |
| Prompt directory | Directory containing your prompt `.md` files (relative to vault root) | ✓ |
| Image output directory | Directory where generated images will be saved (relative to vault root, empty = vault root) | |
| Notification delay | Seconds before showing "Generating..." notification (0 = immediate) | |

### `.env` File Format

Create a `.env` file **outside your vault** with the following content:

```ini
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini #LLM Provider is currently fixed to GEMINI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3-pro-image-preview
```

**Recommended path**: Use `~/.config/genimage-inserter/.env` to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).

> ⚠️ **Security**: The `.env` file must be outside your vault to prevent accidental sync or exposure of your API key.

### Prompt Files

Create `.md` files in your prompt directory. Each file can optionally include YAML frontmatter to specify image generation parameters:

```markdown
---
aspect_ratio: "16:9"
image_size: "2K"
---
Your system prompt text here...

Describe what kind of images you want the AI to generate.
```

#### Available Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Default | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| `aspect_ratio` | `1:1`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `16:9`, `21:9` | `1:1` | Works with all models |
| `image_size` | `1K`, `2K`, `4K` | `1K` | Only works with `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` |

#### Example Prompt Files

**Illustration style (`illustration.md`):**
```markdown
---
aspect_ratio: "16:9"
image_size: "2K"
---
You are an illustrator. Create a beautiful illustration based on the following text.
Use vibrant colors and warm, inviting style.
```

**Photorealistic (`realistic.md`):**
```markdown
---
aspect_ratio: "1:1"
---
Generate a photorealistic image based on the following text.
Focus on natural lighting and composition.
```

**Simple (no frontmatter, uses defaults):**
```markdown
Create an image based on the following text.
```

## Usage

1. Open a note in Obsidian
2. Right-click and select **Generate image**
3. Choose a prompt template from the modal
4. Wait for the image to be generated
5. The image is automatically saved and inserted into your note

### With Selected Text

If you select text before right-clicking:
- The selected text is sent to the AI as context
- The generated image is inserted **at the end of the selection**

### Without Selection (Entire Note)

If no text is selected:
- The entire note content is sent to the AI as context
- The generated image is inserted **at the end of the note**

> ⚠️ **Note**: The image link is inserted at the last line of the note with a single line break. If your note ends within a code block (` ``` `), fenced block, or other Markdown structure, the image link may be inserted inside that structure and displayed as plain text. In such cases, manually move the image link outside the structure.

### Output Structure

Generated images are saved in a folder named after your note:

```
{image output directory}/{note name}/{timestamp}_{note_name}.{ext}
```

Example: If your note is "My Travels" and output directory is `assets/generated`:
```
assets/generated/My Travels/20260207143052_My_Travels.png
```

### Image Link Format

Images are inserted using standard Markdown syntax for maximum compatibility:

```markdown
![](assets/generated/My%20Travels/20260207143052_My_Travels.png)
```

## Logging

Logs are saved to `.obsidian/plugins/genimage-inserter/genimage-inserter.log` for debugging purposes.
